# Static HTML Page for Link-in-Bio

> Forked from [appdev-projects/static-html-template](https://github.com/appdev-projects/static-html-template)

This is a simple static site inspired by Linktree. I modified the original HTML and CSS to create a "link-in-bio" style page.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally:

```bash
bin/server
```
This starts a Python HTTP server on port 3000
